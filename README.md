This Repo is for rules for agentic coding with the **Continue-Plugin** [https://www.continue.dev/](https://www.continue.dev/). 
I created it, because the [Awesome Rules Repo](https://github.com/continuedev/awesome-rules) does not contain Java specific rules.

See more info on my website [ai-telligence.info](https://ai-telligence.info)
